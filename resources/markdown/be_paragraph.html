<p>A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a
blank line -- a line containing nothing spaces or tabs is considered
blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be intended with spaces or tabs.</p>

<p>Markdown offers two styles of headers: <em>Setext</em> and <em>atx</em>.
Setext-style headers for <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> are created by
"underlining" with equal signs (<code>=</code>) and hyphens (<code>-</code>), respectively.
To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (<code>#</code>) at the
beginning of the line -- the number of hashes equals the resulting
HTML header level.</p>
